        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red
        junglefowl
        species that are originally from Southeast Asia. They have also
        partially hybridized with other wild species of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">junglefowls</a> (the
        grey
        junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and
        cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female
        bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a
        pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
        both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally they were also bred
        for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
        domesticated for meat are broilers and for eggs are layers.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more
        than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any
        other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth,
        folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of
        within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade
        found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated
        from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to
        the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th
        century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from
        the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals
        of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th
        century BC.[7][8]
